### **What is this app all about?**

Your emotional state is just like the weather – it changes daily! In this app, you’ll see how your moods align with various weather conditions. Here’s how we map it out:

- **Sunny 🌞**: You’re feeling happy, energized, and ready to take on the world.
- **Cloudy ☁️**: Your mood is neutral or maybe a bit contemplative.
- **Rainy 🌧️**: You’re feeling down, sad, or perhaps a little anxious.
- **Stormy ⛈️**: You’re overwhelmed, angry, or just need to let it all out.
