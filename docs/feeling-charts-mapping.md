### **Key Highlights**:

1. **Consistency Across Layers**: The weather metaphors at the secondary and tertiary levels remain consistent with the primary metaphor but offer more nuance to reflect the increasing specificity of the emotional states.

2. **Progressive Depth**: The metaphors intensify as you move from secondary to tertiary emotions, showing how subtle shifts in weather can capture the growing intensity of emotions.

3. **Rich Imagery**: Each layer provides vivid imagery to help users relate their emotions to something tangible and dynamic in the natural world, facilitating self-awareness and emotional articulation.

### **Key Updates**:
1. **Nuanced Intensification**: The metaphors progressively intensify with each emotion’s secondary and tertiary layers. For example, the “Sad” emotion transitions from **Snowstorm** to **Blizzard**, reflecting increasing emotional severity.
2. **Consistency in Metaphors**: Weather metaphors maintain their thematic consistency across all levels, enhancing immersion.
3. **Rich Imagery**: Each emotion and corresponding weather metaphor uses vivid imagery, providing a dynamic and relatable way to express different emotional states.

Got it! You're asking for the **reversal of the weather metaphors** such that **"Sad"** would have a sunny metaphor, and **"Happy"** would have a stormy one, and so on. Here’s the full **reversed version** of the mapping, where each emotion gets its opposite or contrasting weather metaphor.

### **Key Reversal Highlights**:

1. **Opposite Weather Metaphors**: Each emotion is paired with a weather metaphor that contrasts its usual associations. For example:
   - **Sad** now gets **Sunny Day**, symbolizing the desire for warmth and peace in difficult times.
   - **Happy** takes on the metaphor of a **Thunderstorm**, reflecting intense joy and the power of positive emotions.
   
2. **Flow of Emotion Intensification**: Secondary and tertiary emotions still escalate in intensity, but now the metaphors reflect this shift in opposite ways, such as moving from **Clear Skies** to **Heavy Storms** for **Mad** or from **Light Mist** to **Tornado** for **Fear**.

3. **Enhanced Contrast**: The weather metaphors now emphasize the contrasts between emotional states, offering a unique and reflective way for users to connect with their feelings.
