Hey friends!
This is my story: how do you find the true self? : r/AskReddit
I am  developing a mood tracker app that uses weather conditions  to metaphor/represent how you feel—sunny for a good mood, rainy for a low mood, and stormy for when you’re feeling overwhelmed or stressed. I wanted to create something simple and fun that makes tracking emotions easier and more relatable.
it would auto determine mood weather  and mood score from your words, give you proper app wallpaper for this mood weather and you can definitely change it with any in your collections.
you can find friends that can inspire you.
i also want to use metaphor inside mood change pattern  recongition and  use weather as indicator inside mood calendar
I’ve always found traditional mood trackers hard to stick with, so I thought this weather metaphor could make it feel more intuitive. I’d love to hear your thoughts:
Would you find a weather-based mood tracker helpful?
What weather would you choose to represent your emotions today?
Any suggestions for features I should add?
